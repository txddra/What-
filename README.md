# What-I-learned-in-week-3
During week 3 we learned about:

Strings, Numbers,Booleans, `if statements`, else statements and code wars.

*Strings* - sometimes written as 'Str' is a very common shorthand as a parameter or variable.

*Whitespace* - will still work but make it harder to read, spacing matters, for individual words.

 __we don't use kabob case in javascript.__

*Booleans* - are true or false statements.
 
*Camel Case* - starts lowercase letter, every new word gets a capital letter. 

__values cannot reassign values__

__variables can be changed whenever__
